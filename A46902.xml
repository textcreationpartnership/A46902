            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALmighty <hi>God,</hi> out of his infinite Goodneſs to this World, through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Son <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> ordained or made choyce of Three Vertues, whereby we muſt walk; which are theſe, <hi>viz.

Firſt,</hi> By the Virtue of <hi>Faith,</hi> we are to believe all things that are done in this World. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By Virtue of <hi>Hope,</hi> we are to believe and hope for all things in another World: And the Reaſon why Chriſtians do believe this <hi>Hope,</hi> is to bring and conduct them to Salvation in the other World. And if we Hope in <hi>God,</hi> we cannot but Believe <hi>God:</hi> For <hi>with the Mouth, Confeſſion is made; but with the Heart,</hi> (and through <hi>Faith) we muſt believe unto Salvation.</hi> So that <hi>Faith</hi> is not to be trodden under Foot, or to be hidden under a Buſhel; but to be ſet upon a Candleſtick. <hi>Luke</hi> the 12th. <hi>Whoſoever doth confeſs me before Men, him will I confeſs before the Angels of God; And him that denies me before Men, him will I deny before the Angels of God.</hi> And therefore, all are bound to believe, that there is but one <hi>Faith;</hi> and if but one <hi>Faith,</hi> then but one <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi> There is but one <hi>Faith,</hi> one <hi>Lord,</hi> one <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> And if it be ſo, How can this ſtand with ſo many Sectaries as there are?

            <p>I come to the Third Virtue, and that is <hi>Charity.</hi> It's true now this Body of mine in this Shipwrack, is full of Sin; but when that Shipwrack is over, I ſhall come to inherit that <hi>Rock,</hi> that ſhall never fail.

            <p>'Tis Expected I ſhould ſay ſomething of the Plot: as to this, I ſhall declare two points of my faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I believe, that all are bound to obey the King and his Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I do declare, that thoſe that do break the Law in Word, or any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that doth Act any thing againſt his Majeſties Life, that it is a ſin unto dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as much as it was a ſin in <hi>Judas</hi> to betray Chriſt. An Oath, is taking God to witneſs; and is as much as if he took his Life and Juſtice to ſtake; ſo that he that takes a falſe Oath, is guilty of deſtroying the Life of God, and his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and of his own Damnation: And if I were but Guilty of this, I do declare, that all the ſin of Damnation would fall upon me, becauſe I denyed the truth, and ſo ſtruck at God by my ſin, by denying of the Truth, that one Damnation.</p>
            <p>A Second Damnation is, that if any man know of an evil againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, his Kingdome and Nation, and to hide, or not diſcover it, he ſhall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for thoſe Miſchiefs that come thereby: ſo that a man would have made and Committed as many ſins as there are men in <hi>England,</hi> that had ſuffered.</p>
            <p>A Third Damnation is, to die in this Lie, and with this perjury in his mouth; that he loſes Heaven and all the enjoyments, and dies in greater ſins than the Devils themſelves.</p>

               <p>Now I have no more to do, but to make my addreſs to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God with all the powers of my ſoul, that I may have his mercy and pardon of my ſins; and therefore I beg, that all the Catholicks that joyn in union of this ſame Faith, would make an addreſs unto God for me that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive pardon for our Sins: I have nothing now, but wiſhes left; I wiſh I may Imitate <hi>David</hi> in his Repentance, and that <hi>My Eyes may run down with Tears, becauſe I have not kept God's Laws.</hi> I wiſh with the prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of waters may fall from my Eyes, by reaſon of ſin,</hi> Lam. 3.48. But Tears will not be proper to me at this time, I have kept my ſelf from them, left by ſhedding Tears, ſome might ſay, I was unwilling to die, or feared death: but inſtead of Tears, I offer all the Blood in my veins; and I wiſh every drop were an Ocean, and I would offer it up unto God; and I wiſh, that I might become a Man like <hi>David;</hi> I wiſh I had <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> penitential Tears; I wiſh I had her Arms to embrace the feet of mercy; I wiſh I had all the Graces of Saints and Angels, and I would offer them all to God for the Romiſſion of my ſin: this is my deſire, and this I wiſh for, as much as is in me. I offer firſt my Life, and I beſeech and deſire of God, to turn his face from my ſins, but not from me. I offer up my Life in ſatisfaction for my ſins, and for the Catholick Cauſe: and I beg for thoſe that be my Enemies in this my death, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have them forgiven, becauſe I go to that World of Happineſs, ſooner than I ſhould have gone. And, humbly beg pardon from God and the World; And this I beg for the Merits and Mercy of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I beſeech <hi>God</hi> to bleſs his Majeſty; and give him a long Life, and happy Reign in this World, and in the World to come. I beſeech God to bleſs all my Benefactors, and all my Friends, and thoſe that have been any way under my charge. I beſeech God to bleſs all the Catholicks, and this Nation, and his Majeſties privy Council; and grant that they may Act no otherwiſe, than what may be for the Glory of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>So I beſeech God, that he will give them Grace to ſerve him.</p>
               <p>I beſeech God to Bleſs the Parliament that is now in Election, that they may determine nothing, but what they themſelves do hope to be judged by at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>I beſeech <hi>God</hi> to bleſs all that ſuffer under this Perſecution, and to turn this our Captivity into Joy; that they which Sow now in Tears, may Reap in Joy.</p>
               <p>I beſeech <hi>God</hi> to ſave the Death of my Body, and to receive my Soul. I have no more to ſay.</p>

               <p>ANd thus this <hi>Popiſh</hi> Faction deſign to delude the World, by pretending that they dye only as Martyrs for their Religion; This Prieſt, with great Aſſeverations denies his knowledg of the Horrid and Damnable Plot, wherein we have not much reaſon to give credit to him, ſince it has been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo fully and undenyably demonſtrated, That Lies, Equivocations; yea and the moſt ſolemn Aſſeverations to an untruth, even at the laſt Moment, is not only Lawful, but Meritorious, when it may advance the Intereſt of <hi>Holy Church.</hi> Beſides, if I forbid a man to come into my Houſe upon pain of death, and he will be ſo obſtinate, notwithſtanding he knows the penalty, to ruſh in upon me, if he loſe his Life in the Quarrel, he will be Judged by all wiſe men to dye like a Fool, and his blood is upon his own head. Again, we are fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that whoever ſhall ſeduce any of the Subjects of this Kingdome to the Popiſh Religion, does at the ſame Inſtant, make the Perſon Seduced a Rebel and Traytor againſt his Prince and Countrey; ſince in a Letter written by that bleſſed Saint <hi>Hartcourt,</hi> lately departed at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> He does there allow his Proſelytes to take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; reſerving the ſence they take it in, to themſelves; whereby we may evidently perceive, that they make uſe of Religion only as a Politick Engine, which they manage as may beſt ſerve their curſed deſigns; and that no Oaths, Teſts, or Obligations whatſoever, can poſſibly bind or oblige them, but that they may be Indulged in breaking or evading the force thereof, which our wiſe Anceſtors were very ſenſible of; and therefore with great prudence made this Excellent Law againſt their Leaders, ſince (if a Factious Prieſt have the ſole Command of the Conſcience, and that whatever he Commands muſt be indiſpenſable obeyed) no Prince, nor Government can poſſibly be ſafe or ſecure; and therefore Perſons of ſuch Principles as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy avow and own, ought with the greateſt Reaſon to be hooted out of the World, as being the moſt curſed, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemies to man-kind. Let us therefore conclude with the Prayer of the Church in the Old Liturgy.</p>
